i have a client who would like to use the simulations developed by phetsims at https://github.com/phetsims - and would like me to build a website either in laravel+react or nextjs that has most if not all the simulations in one systemThe best and simplest way to build a website featuring most or all PhET Interactive Simulations (from the University of Colorado Boulder's PhET project) is to embed them via iframes from the official site. This avoids legal/complexity issues with bulk downloading and self-hosting, while complying with their licensing and terms.
Why Embedding is Recommended

PhET provides an official "Embed" button on each simulation page, generating ready-to-use iframe code (e.g., <iframe src="https://phet.colorado.edu/sims/html/simulation-name/latest/simulation-name_en.html" width="834" height="504" ...></iframe>). This loads the latest version directly from their servers.
Simulations are freely embeddable under CC BY 4.0 (attribution required: "PhET Interactive Simulations, University of Colorado Boulder, https://phet.colorado.edu").
No need to handle downloads, updates, file management, or potential compatibility issues (e.g., assets loading, browser support). PhET handles hosting, translations, and maintenance.
There are ~170+ HTML5 simulations (the modern, recommended ones; legacy Java ones may use CheerpJ wrappers, but focus on HTML5).
Embedding works well in modern frameworks like Next.js or Laravel + React.

Implementation Options

Next.js (Recommended for a Modern, Fast Site)
Next.js is great for this: server-side rendering, static generation, and easy React components.
Create a central index/list page pulling from PhET's categories (physics, chemistry, etc.) — you can manually curate or scrape/list them (their site has an API-like structure or you can hardcode/browse https://phet.colorado.edu/en/simulations).
Build a dynamic route for each sim, e.g., /sim/[slug], where you render an iframe with the corresponding URL.
Example component:jsx// components/PhETSimulation.js
export default function PhETSimulation({ simUrl }) {
  return (
    <div style={{ position: 'relative', paddingBottom: '60.43%', height: 0 }}>
      <iframe
        src={simUrl}
        width="100%"
        height="100%"
        frameBorder="0"
        style={{ position: 'absolute', top: 0, left: 0 }}
        allowFullScreen
      ></iframe>
    </div>
  );
}
Add attribution footer on each page.
For a dashboard/all-in-one: use tabs or a searchable grid of thumbnails/links (PhET provides thumbnails on their site; you can search_images if needed for visuals, but link to embeds).
Benefits: Fast, SEO-friendly, mobile-responsive, easy to add features like favorites or search.

Laravel + React (If You Prefer Backend-Heavy or Existing Laravel Setup)
Use Laravel for backend (auth, user tracking if needed, database for user favorites/collections).
Frontend: Inertia.js or Laravel + Vite + React for SPA feel.
Store a list of simulations (name, category, embed URL) in a DB or config file.
Render iframes in React components similarly to above.
Add features like user accounts to save preferred sims.


Key Considerations

Performance: Iframes load external content, so use lazy loading (e.g., React.lazy or loading="lazy" attribute) to avoid slowing the site.
Aspect Ratio: PhET recommends ~834x504 for best experience — use responsive wrappers (padding-bottom trick) to maintain it.
Attribution & Branding: Always include visible credit. Don't use PhET logo/name for promotion without their separate license.
Alternatives if Self-Hosting is Required (e.g., for offline intranet):
Download individual HTML5 sims as .zip from each sim page (or desktop app for bulk, though it's app-wrapped).
Unzip, host the folder on your server (the main file is usually simulation-name_en.html or similar).
Some users rename index.html or adjust paths for platforms. But this is manual for 170+ sims, requires updates, and may miss features.
Source code is on GitHub, but building from source needs their toolchain (grunt/chipper) — overkill unless customizing.


Next Steps

Browse https://phet.colorado.edu/en/simulations to catalog the ones your client wants.
Start with a proof-of-concept: pick 5-10 sims, build a simple Next.js site with a list and embed pages.
If needing images for sim thumbnails/descriptions, let me know specifics.

This approach gives a professional, maintainable system quickly. If your client has specific needs (e.g., offline priority, custom UI around sims, analytics), provide more details!2.1sExpert59 sourceslets build basic PoC prototype in nextjs for now and then move over to laravel for userprofiles and tracking in future when client is happy with PoCGreat — let's build a basic Proof-of-Concept (PoC) prototype in Next.js that showcases a collection of PhET simulations via embedding. This will be simple, clean, responsive, and easy to expand later (e.g., add Laravel + auth/user profiles/tracking when the client likes the direction).
Project Goals for PoC

Home page: Grid/list of simulation cards (thumbnail + title + category)
Dynamic simulation page: /sim/[slug] that loads the iframe embed
Responsive iframe wrapper to maintain PhET's recommended aspect ratio (~834×504 → ~1.65 ratio)
Attribution visible on sim pages
Start with 10–15 popular simulations (easy to add more)
No backend/DB yet — hardcode the list in a file/array

Step-by-Step Setup

Create Next.js projectBashnpx create-next-app@latest phet-poc --typescript --eslint --tailwind --app --src-dir --import-alias "@/*"
cd phet-poc
npm run dev(Choose yes for Tailwind — it's great for quick styling.)
Add a data file for simulations

  category: string;      // Physics, Chemistry, etc.
  description?: string;  // short blurb (optional)
  embedUrl: string;      // full embed src, usually latest/en

Quick Wins / Polish Ideas (for PoC)

Add search/filter by category (use state or URL params)
Use PhET thumbnails: e.g. https://phet.colorado.edu/sims/html/[slug]/assets/[slug]-128.png in img tags on cards
Add a simple header/footer with client branding
Make cards show a "Launch" button instead of full link styling

Future: Moving to Laravel
Once client approves:

Extract the sim list to DB (e.g. Laravel model + seeder)
Use Inertia.js (React) or Livewire for frontend
Add user auth, favorites, usage tracking (views/time spent per sim)
Keep embeds the same — just dynamic from DB

Let me know what you'd like to tweak first:

Add more sims?
Include thumbnails?
Add search bar?
Mobile tweaks?

"2 / 2Yes, those installation steps look correct and align well with the PoC setup I recommended. You ran npx create-next-app@latest sis-phet and customized it interactively to include TypeScript, ESLint, Tailwind CSS, src/ directory, App Router, and the @/* import alias—which matches the flags I suggested (e.g., --typescript --eslint --tailwind --app --src-dir --import-alias "@/*"). The only addition is the React Compiler (via babel-plugin-react-compiler), which is a newer experimental feature in Next.js 15 for better performance, but it's optional and won't interfere with our basic prototype.
The project initialized successfully with the app-tw template (App Router + Tailwind), installed all necessary dependencies, generated route types, and even set up a Git repo. No errors or vulnerabilities reported, so you're good to go.
Quick Next Steps

Navigate into the project: cd sis-phet
Start the dev server: npm run dev (visit http://localhost:3000 to see the default Next.js page)
Proceed with adding the files I outlined:
src/data/simulations.ts (hardcoded sim list)
src/components/PhetEmbed.tsx (iframe component)
Update src/app/page.tsx (home grid)
Add src/app/sim/[slug]/page.tsx (dynamic page)


If you encounter any issues during these steps (e.g., TypeScript errors or Tailwind not applying), share the output, and I'll help debug. Otherwise, this sets a solid foundation—once the PoC is running, we can iterate or port to Laravel.
